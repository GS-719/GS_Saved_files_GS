What is Static Site Generation (SSG)?

 	In Next.js, SSG is a powerful pre-rendering method that generates HTML pages at build time, not on every reqeust. This means your pages are generated once and served instantly making your site blazing fast, SEO-	friendly and more scalable, especially when the content does not change often.



Why does the Static Site Generation used?

 	Static Site Generation (SSG) is used because it solves a critical set of problems in modern web development: Speed, Scalability, Reliability, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Cost-Effiency and 	security challenges -- especially for content that doesn't change frequently.



What problem does the Static Site Generation solve?

 	slow page loads and high server load

 		Since pages are generated as plan HTML at build time, they can be served instantly from a CDN - no database queries or server logic needed on each request.

 	Poor SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Discoverability

 		Search engines can easily index static content - Search Engines love pre-rendered HTML. SSG ensures that crawlers can see the full content immediately, boosting your site's visibility.

 	higher deployment cost

 		because pages are static and don't require server processing per request, you can deploy them on cheap or free hosting platforms (like Vercel, Netlify) without scaling backends.

 	Reliability

 		With no backend logic at runtime, there's less chance of errors or downtime. The static pages are always available.

 	Complex development

 		You don't need to maintain a database or runtime environment unless you're using dynamic features separately.

 	Security vulnerabilities

 		Since SSG produces pre-rendered HTML files at build time, it eliminates many of the vulnerabilities associated with dynamic server-side rendering.



How Static Site Generation works?

 	Static Site Generation (SSG) works by building your website’s HTML pages ahead of time—during the 	build process—rather than on-the-fly when a user visits the site. This makes your site faster, more secure, 	and easier to scale.



Where do you use Static Site Generation in a real world project?

Static Site Generation (SSG) shines in real world projects where performance, SEO and Security is to prioritise and where data (Content) doesn't change frequently.

Example:-

Blogging website

Documentation

News

Resume Hosting Site

Marketing Landing page

Event website



When should you avoid Static Site Generation?

You should avoid Static Site Generation (SSG) when your project or specific pages require real-time, frequently changing, or user-specific data taht cannot be efficiently pre-build at build time.

For Example:-

Dynamic Data (Data Changes very frequently)

 	Problem: Static Site Genertation builds pages once at build, if our data changes every minute, pages can quicky become outdated.

 	Example: Stock market dashboard, Live Sports Score, Cryoptocurrency price trackers etc.



Large Site with Dynamic content

 	Problem: If you have millions of pages (e.g. large e-commarce stores, social media platforms). generating them all at build time can be slow or impossible.

 	Example: Amazon's products pages and facebook or instagram where new content are constantly added.



User-Specific or Personalized Content

 	Problem: Static Site Generation (SSG) generates the same static page for everyone, so it's not suitable for content that changes per user (e.g., based on login session or preferences).

 	Example: User dashboards, personalized recommendations, shopping carts etc.



Build time becomes too slow

 	Problem: If your site has thousands of pages and Static Site Generation in used for all of them, build times may take hours.

 	Example: A news website publishing thousands of articles daily.



Rules of Thumb (to use Static Site Generation):-

 	Use SSG - for Static or rarely changing data (blogs, documentation, marketing pages etc.).

 	Avoid SSG - for fast-charging, user-specific, or real-time content.





How does SSG affect SEO and page performance?

SSG (Static Site Generation), SSR (Server-Side Rendering), and CSR (Client-Side Rendering) each affect SEO and page performance differently.- SSG is ideal for SEO because search engines can instantly crawl and index static HTML.

Static Site Generation (SSG) is best for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Page performance because:-

 	Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

 		Full HTML is ready at load time → Search engine crawlers get complete content instantly, without waiting for JavaScript to run.

 		Consistent meta data → Titles, descriptions, and structured data are baked into the HTML, ensuring accurate SERP display.

 		Better indexing → Since Googlebot and other crawlers don’t need to execute JS, your pages are indexed faster and more reliably.

 		Improved crawl budget → Search engines can crawl more of your site within the same time frame, as there’s no rendering delay.

 	Result: Higher rankings, faster indexing, and stronger organic traffic potential — especially for blogs, landing pages, documentation, and product listings.

 	Page performance

 		Very low TTFB (Time to First Byte) → The server or CDN just serves a prebuilt HTML file.

 		Fast FCP (First Contentful Paint) → Content appears almost immediately because the HTML is complete from the start.

 		Global CDN distribution → Static pages can be cached and served from servers near the user, reducing latency.

 		No server computation on request → Eliminates the bottleneck of rendering pages for each visitor.

 	Result: Faster load times, better Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID), and improved user experience — which indirectly benefits SEO since Google factors page experience into rankings.
